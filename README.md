# Fast Food Dataset Classification

This project focuses on the classification of the **Fast Food Dataset** using different deep learning approaches. The project is divided into three main parts: **MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)**, **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**, and **Transfer Learning**.

## Project Overview

The notebook includes:

- **Data preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalization, and preparation for model training.
- **Model training**: Implementation and training of MLP, CNN, and Transfer Learning models.
- **Evaluation and comparison**: Analysis of model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to compare different deep learning techniques for image classification and understand their strengths and weaknesses on the Fast Food Dataset.
